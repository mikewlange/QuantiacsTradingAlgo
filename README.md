Lots of typos in the comments - don't feel like fixing.. 

I wrote this a couple years ago for https://www.quantiacs.com/. 

This is different than any automated trading program I've ever written. Normally, I program day-trading systems. Not HFT's but just a few a day and always in cash by market close. 

This is a, "what could you do with a million dollar portfolio that needs consistant low risk returns". So my approach had to be a little different. Quite different actually. Didn't even know where to begin, so I tryied somthing pretty stupid to tell you the truth. Lots of code and thought was needed to derive these equations - before I even thought the concept would work. Well, I knoew it would eventualy, it's not magic, just lots of complextity to spit out something that works - the code posted. 

I simplified the shit out of genetic mathematical model creation. When you look at the models for each derivative you'll prob wonder, "how the hell did he come up with those constants? you curve fitting assole. that math is easy, I thought quantitative trading was complex."

And you would be right, most unmanaged trading systems require a lot more thought than I put into this. But, I've always been a fan of finding the shortest path to a goal.

So, since I've never written programs to trade a large portfolio over a long period of time. Not going after the daly returns, but low risk w/ solid Sharpe and Sorento over decades worth of data. 

So I did what I know how to do, write some code tosolve that problem for me.

Just Arithmetic?

Yup. 3rd grade math is all you need to design a highly effecient predictive fincial models if ehought quality data is at my disposal. 

**Simplicity**

> Feedforward modeling that processes sequential number sequences (time searies data) into predictive arithmetic models using ONLY atomic functions and operators. 
> Can't post the code for the modeler, just because. But this is just the first of a TON of trading programs and software I have written that I will provide the full source for. 

If you want to test the model, download the **Matlab** back-tester here: https://www.quantiacs.com/For-Quants/GetStarted/QuantiacsToolbox.aspx. 

Enjoy and sorry for not posting the guts for this one. But I'll be open sourcing all my trading stuff soon and most are written in c or c# for Ninja or Multi Charts. Indicators, Strategies, UI overhauls, you name it. And those are day traders. Some simple, some complex. And no more Matlab, yuk. 

So stay tuned. 

Feel free to use this and make millions if you can!!
